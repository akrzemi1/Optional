Optional
========

A library for optional (nullable) objects for C++11. This is the reference implementation of proposal N3527 (see see http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3527.html). Optional is now accepted into C++14 with modified wording as N3672. The interface is based on Fernando Cacciola's Boost.Optional library (http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_52_0/libs/optional/doc/html/index.html)


Supported compilers
-------------------

Clang 3.2+, G++ 4.7.2 (and probably later)


Usage
-----

```cpp
optional<int> readInt(); // this function may return int or a not-an-int

if (optional<int> oi = readInt()) // did I get a real int
  cout << "my int is: " << *oi;   // use my int
else
  cout << "I have no int";
```

For more usage examples and the overview see http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3527.html


Differences from N3527
----------------------

 - The constructor taking `initializer_list` argument is not `constexpr`. This is because `initializer_list` operations are not `constexpr` in C++11.
 - Member function `value_or` does not have rvalue reference overload in GCC. This is because rvalue overloding on `*this` is not supported in GCC 4.7.2.
